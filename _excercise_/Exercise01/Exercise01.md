### <a name="exercise-landscape"></a> Exercise landscape
This session focuses primarily on user interface development based on existing backend services that are already deployed for you. There are **two** services available for this landacpe. One from Java and another one from node.js.

* Service provided by Java
	- BookingService
	- FlightService
	
* Service provided by node.js
	- xsODataservice 

For the database model of the 2 services, please refer to the TechEd session [CNA262](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sample-spaceflight-hana).
For Java service, please refer to the TechEd session [CNA376](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sample-spaceflight-java).
The node.js service we are going to use for this session is based on a calculation view on top of our SAP HANA DB. If you are interested to develop business applications using node.js service please refer to TechEd session [CNA375](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sample-spaceflight-node).

The database model, Java service, and node.js service are developed using *The Application Programming Model* via "SAP Web IDE Full-Stack" development tool.

### <a name="access-neo"></a>Access SAP Cloud Platform Neo account
You need SAP Cloud Platform Neo account to access "SAP Web IDE Full-Stack" and the destination for the services.

1.	Access SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit for Neo account via <http://bit.ly/sapcp462>. Please login with the **P_userid** provided by the instructors.
